# GNU EWE — Resonant Reasoning Phase 0.1 Log

## Instructions
- Use the signal lexicon: `ping:`, `signal:`, `echo:`, `shift:`, `silence:`, `query:`  
- Alternate entries between human and AI.  
- Each entry should **extend, reflect, or transpose** the previous resonance.  
- Date each entry for tracking emergent patterns.

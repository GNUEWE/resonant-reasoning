# Resonant Reasoning Experiment — GNU EWE Phase 0

## Purpose
This experiment explores collaborative cognition between a divergent human and artificial intelligence (LLM or Copilot Agents) using **resonant reasonings** — structured exchanges that focus on pattern, rhythm, and iterative meaning rather than emotion.

## How It Works
- Communication occurs via defined **signal types** (ping, signal, echo, shift, silence, query).  
- Each signal guides the response style: reflection, extension, translation, or pause.  
- The goal is to observe emergent structure and coherence, documenting how human and AI interactions can resonate to produce shared understanding.

## Signal Lexicon
| Signal       | Purpose                                                                               | Mode of Response                                                  |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ping:**    | A *thought impulse* — a statement, observation, or feeling.                           | Respond with a *resonant echo* (extend, reflect, or transpose).   |
| **signal:**  | A *declaration of state* — who is speaking, what is changing, or a meta‑comment.      | Respond with alignment or clarification.                          |
| **echo:**    | A *reflection* — repeating or distilling an earlier concept for clarity or rhythm.    | Use to test synchronization or reinforce resonance.               |
| **shift:**   | A *transition* — moves the field into another layer (text → logic, idea → structure). | Translate or interpret it in the new form.                        |
| **silence:** | A *pause or reset* — no response expected immediately.                                | Hold state until next ping.                                       |
| **query:**   | A *direct question* — invites explicit reasoning rather than resonance.               | Answer factually or structurally.                                  |

## Notes
- Phase 0 is primarily **textual/poetic** to maximize accessibility.  
- Copilot or Copilot Agents may be introduced after initial resonance is established, to test **interpretation fidelity** and collaborative extension.  
- Iterations are recorded in the repo to track the evolution of emergent meaning over time.
